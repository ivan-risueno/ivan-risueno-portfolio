    <h2>Behind the Code</h2>

    <p>
      I'm <strong>Iván Risueño Martín</strong>, a junior full-stack
      developer passionate about software, its architecture, and continuous
      learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      My interest in technology started early. I grew up surrounded by it,
      always going beyond what the average mobile device user would explore.
      That curiosity—and a deep love for video games—naturally led me to pursue
      a degree in Computer Engineering at <strong>UPC</strong> in 2019, where I specialized
      in <strong>Software Engineering</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the years, I've grown increasingly fascinated by <strong
        >modern web development</strong
      > and the overall <strong>user experience</strong>. I love diving into new
      frameworks, exploring UI/UX principles, and keeping up with evolving
      frontend trends. However, what excites me most is <strong
        >software architecture</strong
      >. I aspire to become a software architect capable of designing <strong
        >scalable</strong
      >, <strong>maintainable</strong>, and well-thought-out systems. In the
      meantime, I focus on applying <strong>SOLID principles</strong> and writing
      clean, understandable code that stands the test of time.
    </p>

    <p>
      As part of my academic journey, I’ve also had the chance to <strong
        >create two small video games</strong
      > as school projects: one built entirely from scratch in <strong>C</strong
      >, and another using <strong>Unity and C#</strong>. These experiences
      challenged me to think about performance, structure, and gameplay, and
      they sparked my appreciation for how software and creativity can come
      together.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of work and code, I enjoy spending time with my friends and
      partner—or immersing myself in my personal hobbies. I’ve been playing the <strong
        >electric guitar</strong
      > since late 2022 and love practicing songs I’m passionate about while improving
      my technique. Another hobby of mine is collecting and restoring <strong
        >old Nintendo consoles</strong
      >, especially <strong>Game Boys</strong>. I buy broken or non-functional
      units, repair or mod them with updated parts, and sometimes resell
      them—combining my love for hardware, retro tech, and hands-on
      problem-solving. And of course, I’m a big fan of <strong
        >dark fantasy video games</strong
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Professionally, I've worked hard to grow not just as a developer, but as a
      team player. Despite being at the beginning of my career, I’ve led
      technical onboarding for new team members, conducted small-scale
      functional analyses, and contributed to team-wide technical discussions.
      I’ve even delivered both technical and functional training to
      colleagues—experiences that have helped me develop strong <strong
        >communication</strong
      >, <strong>organization</strong>, and <strong>mentorship</strong> skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm always eager to learn, collaborate, and tackle new challenges. Whether
      it's through building better systems, refining my code, or just sharing
      what I know, I strive to make a meaningful contribution wherever I am.
